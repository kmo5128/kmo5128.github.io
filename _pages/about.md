Welcome! I am a social scientist with [The Lab @ DC](https://thelab.dc.gov) using evidence-based research to develop and evaluate government programs. I currently work on topics related to behavioral health, housing, and use of emergency services. 

I received a Ph.D. in Neuroscience from Georgetown University where I trained in the [Laboratory on Social & Affective Neuroscience](https://abigailmarsh.com/lab/). Previously, I earned a B.S. in Biology from The Pennsylvania State University and completed research training at the National Institute of Mental Health in the Section on Neurobiology of Fear and Anxiety. I use methods such as computational modeling and randomized controlled trials to answer research questions about human behavior and health. 

When not doing research, you can probably find me at a park with my kids and dog, [Mr. Beau](https://kmo5128.github.io/images/mrbeau.png), or searching for the perfect slice of pizza.
