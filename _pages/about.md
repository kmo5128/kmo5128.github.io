Welcome! I am a social scientist with [The Lab @ DC](https://thelab.dc.gov) using evidence-based research to develop and evaluate government programs. I currently work on topics related to behavioral health, housing, and use of emergency services. 

I received a Ph.D. in Neuroscience from Georgetown University where I trained in the [Laboratory on Social & Affective Neuroscience](https://abigailmarsh.com/lab/). Previously, I earned a B.S. in Biology from The Pennsylvania State University and completed post-baccalaureate research training at the National Institute of Mental Health in the Section on Neurobiology of Fear and Anxiety. I have used methods such as computational modeling, brain imaging, and randomized controlled trials to answer behavioral neuroscience research questions. 

When not doing research, you can probably find me at the park with my two kids and dog, [Mr. Beau](https://kmo5128.github.io/images/mrbeau.png), or searching for the perfect slice of pizza.
