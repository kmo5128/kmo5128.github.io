I am a Neuroscience Ph.D. candidate in the Laboratory on Social and Affective Neuroscience at Georgetown University working with [Dr. Abigail Marsh](https://aamarsh.wordpress.com). I earned a B.S. in Biology from The Pennsylvania State University and completed post-baccalaureate research training at the National Institute of Mental Health in the [Section on Neurobiology of Fear and Anxiety](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-conducted-at-nimh/research-areas/clinics-and-labs/snfa/index.shtml).

I study the interaction between negative affect and social functioning using MRI brain imaging, psychophysiology, and behavioral modeling. I am interested in how the brain perceives and experiences emotion and aversive events ranging from monetary loss to acute pain. What are the consequences of disruption to emotion perception and experience, for example, after a [stroke](https://cbpr.georgetown.edu/researchlabs/cognition-and-emotion/)? Might certain types of meditation reliably alter social or affective experiences?

When not doing research, you can probably find me at the park with my dog, [Mr. Beau](https://kmo5128.github.io/images/mrbeau.png), or searching for the perfect slice of pizza.
